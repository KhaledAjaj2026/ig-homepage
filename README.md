# Instagram Homepage Replica

Micro project meant for refreshing my knowledge in React, after a period of only making VanillaJS sites.

## Lessons Learned

Very simple app, used IG homepage as an example for styling. Enjoyed getting components responsive to viewport size. First time using Vite build-tool instead of CRA, was very easy to understand docs and immediately started developing.

Deliberately separated parts of a post into components to learn about child components, which lead to my understanding of passing props to child components. Learned about JSON files and accessing them in component props. Learned about PropTypes and the need to specify component-property types for React.

## Possible Future Features

* Making wide images appear larger by setting width of image according to viewport width.
* Adding ability to make your own post and delete post.
